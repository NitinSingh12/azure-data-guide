## <a name="meaning"></a> What do we mean by common data architectures?
We provide common data architectures to represent the _big concepts_ that deal with data that you need to know. Knowing these common data architectures empowers you to make the right architectural selections for your scenario and, by extension, the right technology choices.

## <a name="use"></a> How do you approach using them?
To understand how to apply a common data architecture to your scenario, start with the question, "What are my requirements?" We divided the various data needs into the following categories:

- [Relational data](./relational-data.md)
- [Non-relational data](./non-relational-data.md)
- [Big data](./big-data.md)
- [Data pipelines](./data-pipeline.md)
- [Advanced analytics](./advanced-analytics.md)

For implementation examples of these common data architectures, see [Implementation Examples](../overview.md#implementation-examples) in the [Azure Data Architecture Guide Overview](../overview.md).

Use the following flow chart to begin your exploration: <!-- Note that the image uses "Nonrelational" it should be hyphenated to match the text. Typically the prefix "non" doesn't take a hyphen, but this is one of those terms that does.-->

The common data architectures will guide you down a path of concepts that get more granular from the concept down to the generic form of technologies used in the architecture, and ultimately to help you make a choice amongst the various Azure options that exist.

If you are curious about a specific topic, you can also navigate this flowchart from right to left, starting with a topic you are familiar with to learn the related topics and how we group them into common architectures in this guide.
