## <a name="meaning"></a> What do we mean by common data architectures?
We provide common data architectures to represent the big concepts that deal with data that you need to know, so that by knowing them you are empowered to make the right architectural selections for your scenario and by extension the right technology choices.  

## <a name="use"></a> How do you approach using them?
To understand how to apply a common data architecture to your scenario, start with the phrase "I need to work with..." and then complete the phrase with one of the following: <!--I made these lowercase because you're completing the sentence.-->
- [relational data](./relational-data.md)
- [non-relational data](./non-relational-data.md)
- [big data](./big-data.md)
- [data pipelines](./data-pipeline.md)
- [advanced analytics](./advanced-analytics.md)

The common data architectures will guide you down a path of concepts that get more granular as you move from the concept down to the generic technologies used in the architecture, and ultimately help you make a choice amongst the various Azure options that exist. 

Use the following flow chart to begin your exploration: <!-- Note that the image uses "Nonrelational" it should be hyphenated to match the text. Typically the prefix "non" doesn't take a hyphen, but this is one of those terms that does.-->

If you are curious about a specify topic, you can also navigate this flowchart from right to left, starting with a topic you are familiar with to learn the related topics and how we group them into common architectures in this guide.
